You know 'em. You love 'em. Or, maybe you don't know 'em, you're waiting for us to tell you why you should love 'em and you're not entirely sure why we're not writing the entire word, "them." We're not gonna spend much time guessing which one of those it is. We've got too much partying to do. So without further to do, ado or updo (actually an updo would look super cute at any of these clubs), here are 10 of the best nightclubs in Las Vegas.

Drai's and Drai's After Hours

Yep. We're cheating already. We said 10 and we've already snuck in another entry. But we just couldn't break these two up. They're both fantastic and they both start with "Drai's." So we figure that's a good enough excuse to let them share a slot. Upstairs, Drai's Nightclub is the style Vegas was built for. It's the cheese pizza of nightclubs – always delicious and never gets old. Drai's After Hours is more like a fine red wine – always delicious and never gets old. That probably says a lot about our dietary habits. But it says more about the elegance that Victor Drai brings to his namesakes. After Hours is much more chill, though the red lighting makes it feel otherwise. The lights may be hot but the mood is always cool. And it's the perfect spot to continue the night after you've danced away whatever few inhibitions you had left at Drai's Nightclub.
